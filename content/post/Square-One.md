As I sit here watching the 24 Heures du Mans, I wonder about the future of these words. What will I write about in the future? What muse will come along to give me ideas to regurgitate out onto these lines. But maybe most paramount; will anyone read them at all.

I plan to mainly just document my journey through the coffee world, I primarily just want a place to record the different experiments that I do and their results. I will try to keep it short and informative.
